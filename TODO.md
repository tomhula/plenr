- disallow negative training length (both frontend and backend)
- trainings which overlap are not drawn properly (they currently fight over the same spot)
- handling of cancelled trainings. What if it should be reopened. Should there be an ability to uncancel a training? I would say no, you have to make a new one, but now there are two same trainings, one is just cancelled. So should the cancelled training be removable altogether?
- in create/update training dialog, when the time or duration is changed, the available participants are not updated
- consider drag and drop functionality in training arrangement (so you can simply drag the training to the new time)
- Loading indication
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization
- Server exception encapsulation
- Use better authentication (JWT?)
- Handle authentication cases. Token not being valid anymore. Basically some call failing due to invalid auth token, so authentication challenge should happen again.
- Add localisation
- Make sure to not send user contact details everywhere (entire UserDto)
- Share as much code as possible between client and server (Constants like URLs, paths, maximum length of fields, etc.)
- Fix database tables create only after accessing the api
- Fix error when mail server cannot be reached. (currently it crashes the frontend, which is bad. Ideally it should either abort the save, notify about the fact or retry later)
- Maybe consider usage of some kind of global styles? So each instance of a component does not repeat the inlined styles, but just has a class.
- Make password reset requests expire
- In user management distinct not yet activated users
- Use bootstrap form validation
  - Add user page
- Allow admin to see busy available times of users
